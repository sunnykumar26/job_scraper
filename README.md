# Backend Application

This is the backend component of [Your Application Name], a web application for web scraping and storing data from a specific website. This repository contains the server-side code responsible for handling requests, managing data, and implementing business logic.

## Overview

The backend application is built using Node.js and Express.js framework. It connects to a MongoDB database to store scraped data and provides endpoints for fetching the scraped data and triggering the scraping process manually.

## Prerequisites

Before running the backend server, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB (Make sure MongoDB server is running)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd backend
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up environment variables:Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
plaintext
Copy code
PORT=4000
MONGO_URL=your-mongodb-connection-string
Replace your-mongodb-connection-string with your MongoDB connection string.
Usage
To start the backend server, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The server will start listening on the port specified in the .env file (default is 4000).

Endpoints
GET /scraper
Retrieves scraped data from the database
GET /trigger-scrape
Manually triggers the scraping process and stores the new data in the database
Database
The backend application uses MongoDB as the database to store scraped data. It includes a single model scrapedData to represent the scraped data.
